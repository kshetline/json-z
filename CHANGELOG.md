### 4.0.0

* Related API for setting an external BigInt handler removed.
* Fixed-precision decimal numbers are now explicitly IEEE 754 Decimal128 numbers.
* Nomenclature to distinguish between fixed-precision and arbitrary-precision decimals has changed. It's now simply Decimal or BigDecimal rather than FixedBigDecimal or BigDecimal.
* Replaced tap testing with mocha/chai test suite.
* Testing for fixed-precision decimals is now done using `proposal-decimal` package from [ECMA TC39 JavaScript Decimal proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal).
* Backtick-quoted strings must escape the `{` character when it follows the `$` to prevent confusion with template literals (`` `${` âžœ `$\{` ``).
